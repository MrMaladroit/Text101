The lighting in the entryway of Vault 210 is abyssmal compared the scorching sunlight of the Phoenix wasteland.
The air is damp and cool. A dream turned nightmarish for the smell of blood in the air was palpable. A sack of body parts 
could be seen on either side of a door leading deeper into the vault. The door opens to a corridor that leads left or right. 

What do you do?
1. You can hear crunching sounds come from a room that is at the end of the hallway going left. Do you approach the open door?
2. There are no discernable sounds coming from the right side of the corridor. It just ends with a door. Do you approach closed door?
