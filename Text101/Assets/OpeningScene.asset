  storyText: "The lighting in the entryway of Vault 210 is abyssmal compared the scorching
    sunlight of the Phoenix wasteland.\r The air is damp and cool. A dream turned
    nightmarish for the smell of blood in the air was palpable. A blood sack of humanoid
    body parts lay on the floor by a door. A telltale sign of a Super Mutant dwelling.
    The room only has one that appears to lead to a corridor that leads left or right
    from this room.\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. You can hear crunching sounds come
    from a room that is at the end of the hallway going left. Do you approach the
    open door?\r\n2. There are no discernable sounds coming from the right side of
    the corridor. It just ends with a door. Do you approach closed door?"
